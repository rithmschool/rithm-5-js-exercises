## CSS Positioning Exercise

In this exercise, you've got an HTML file with a few divs inside of the `body` tag. Your goal is to modify the CSS so that you can make the page look like each of the following screenshots. 

You should ONLY be modifying the CSS in this exercise: don't change anything in the HTML file!

For a lot of these, there are many different ways to acheive the desired layout. Try to focus on using _positioning_, rather than other CSS concepts like margins, flexbox, or floats.
