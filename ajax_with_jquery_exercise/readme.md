# AJAX with jQuery Exercise: Hack-or-Snooze

### In this exercise, we'll rework our Hacker News clone to use AJAX.
### We will be utilizing Rithm's very own [Hack-or-Snooze API](https://hackorsnoozeapi.docs.apiary.io/#). 

## Requirements

The requirements below are listed as Agile/Scrum requirements that you might see on a software engineering kanban board or task list. The tasks are phrased as "User Stories", which means they are written from the perspective of a user/customer.



### To get started with the API, check out the [Quickstart section](https://hackorsnoozeapi.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/quickstart) of the documentation.

### How Token Auth Works
1. Make a request to receive a token (in our case at `/auth`).
1. On subsequent requests you make, the token gets placed in a special request header called `Authorization`.
1. The format is like so: `{ Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token }`, for example: `{ Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1odWV0ZXIiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTAyMDcwMDl9.5oUeihYn2AkqGy6z3g5F5B46gWWgvGKilFr9S4gg-p4'}`.
1. The blob of characters is actually just a base64-encoded payload. You can decode it here: [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/).
1. The token is NOT encrypted, as you can see it's just base64-encoded. This means sensitive data should not travel with it (such as password).
1. The purpose of the token is to let the API know who is making the request (i.e. authentication). The API has a secret/private key that it uses to generate and decode the tokens. It decodes and verifies the tokens on every request.
1. The secret key is unique for every API, so the API will know one of its own tokens when it sees it.
