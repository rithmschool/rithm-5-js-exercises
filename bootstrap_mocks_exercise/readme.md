## Bootstrap Mocks Exercise

There are a number of sample layouts you can build with Bootstrap on the Bootstrap website. In this exercise, your goal is to build one of the layouts below from scratch. Here are your options:

1. [Album](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/)
2. [Cover](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/)
3. [Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/)
4. [Dashboard](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/dashboard/)

Here are some guidelines:

1. __Avoid looking at the Elements tab.__ If you don't know how to acheive some part of the layout, head to the Bootstrap documentation first. You should be able to find anything you need there. Only look to the Elements tab as a last resort.
2. __Minimize the amount of CSS you write.__ One of the biggest upsides to using bootstrap is that it allows to concentrate on content, and worry less about styling issues. So for this exercise, try to write as little of your own CSS as possible. You may not be able to eliminate your own CSS entirely, but see how far you can get without writing a line of CSS.
3. __Customize the look to suit your preferences!__ You should take these designs as sources of inspiration, but feel free to play around with colors, margins, etc. Flexibility here will require you to take a look at the Bootstrap docs to understand how Bootstrap classes are actually working, and it'll allow you to build a layout that's a little more personal.
4. __If you finish one layout and have time, start another!__
